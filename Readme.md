Microservices Architecture:
* User Authentication Service: Handles user registration, login, and authentication.
        * User Authentication Service:
            * Implement endpoints for user registration, login, and authentication using Spring Boot.
            * Use Spring Security for authentication and JWT for token-based authorization.
* Product Management Service: Manages CRUD operations for products.
        * Product Management Service:
            * Create endpoints for CRUD operations on products.
            * Use Spring Data JPA for database interaction and implement optimistic locking for concurrency control.
* Order Processing Service: Handles order creation, retrieval, and management.
        * Order Processing Service:
            * Develop endpoints for managing orders, including creation, retrieval, and updates.
            * Ensure that users can only access their own orders.
Technology Stack:
* Java with Spring Boot: Ideal for building microservices due to its robustness and ease of use.
* PostgreSQL: For database management, providing ACID properties required for transactions.
* Swagger: For documenting RESTful APIs.
* Technology Stack:
* Spring Boot: For building microservices and handling dependencies.
* Spring Data JPA: For database interactions and ORM.
* Spring Security: For authentication and authorization.
* JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure token-based authentication.
* PostgreSQL: As the database to store user information, product data, and order history.
* 
Concurrency Control:
* Optimistic Locking: Implement using Spring Data JPA's @Version annotation for version-based concurrency control.
Clustering and High Availability:
* Use Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka for service discovery and Ribbon for client-side load balancing.
* Deploy microservices on Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage clustering.
Database Schema:
* User: id, username, password, email, role.
* Product: id, name, description, price, stock.
* Order: id, user_id, product_id, quantity, status.
API and Communication:
* RESTful APIs for each microservice.
* User Service: /register, /login.
* Product Service: /products, /products/{id}.
* Order Service: /orders, /orders/{id}.
* Use Spring RestTemplate for synchronous calls between services.
* Use Spring Cloud Stream with RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous communication.
Authentication and Authorization:
* Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
* Define user roles and permissions for authorization.
* Ensure that users can only access their own data.
* Use Spring Security for securing endpoints.
* Implement authorization logic within each microservice based on user roles.
General Requirements:
* Implement comprehensive error handling using Spring Boot's exception handling mechanisms and logging frameworks like Log4j or SLF4J.
